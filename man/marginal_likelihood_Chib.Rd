\title{Likelihood p(V | W) with Chib's method}
\usage{
marginal_likelihood_Chib(V, W, H, C, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{original matrix}

\item{W}{estimated dictionary matrix}

\item{H}{any H matrix}

\item{C}{samples of matrix of auxiliary variables c}
}
\details{
Computes equation 22 of the paper Dikmen, FÃ©votte (2012)
to compute p(H | V, W) we use the samples from the last iterations
since these are closer to the true posterior than the older ones where 
W was not optimal yet.
